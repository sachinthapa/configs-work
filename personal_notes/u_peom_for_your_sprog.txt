---------------Compassion
All the best of life is fleeting,
Unexpected, unrepeating.

Make a person glad to find you.

Leave a better place behind you.

---------------Paris
"The city of love, mon amie," he exclaimed -
"The city of love, mon chérie," he proclaimed -
"I love you in Paris, my darling, my dear -
For love can exist at its pinnacle here!

"The cafés, the tower, la seine and this street!
Together, they tell me that life is complete!
What say you?" he spoke, as he wandered ahead.

She looked at the city.

"I hate it," she said.

------Love
"I love you as much as a... thingy," he said -
"... a something," he wrote with a shake of his head -
"... a waddyacallit," he whispered and then -
"... a whatsit," he started,
and started again.

"I love you because you're amazingly... yes...
You're sort of, and kind of, and really I guess..."
He buried his head in his hands with a sigh.
He pondered improvements,
and gave it a try.

"I love you, because you... but that's not enough -
I love you for all sorts of reasons... and stuff.
These words that I'm writing, and writing to you -
They're all, and besides,
and they're also, and too..."

And so with frustration he paused for a time -
He scribbled discouraged: "I struggle to rhyme.
But here's what's important," he finished below -

"I love you completely.

I want you to know."

------ Withdrawing makes you feel depressed
They asked,
and they asked,
and they asked even though -

Whenever they asked me,
I kept saying no.

I kept saying no,
like I'd done so before.

And one day,
they just didn't ask anymore.

---------Parents
Some parents are weaker than others, it's true.
They're lost,
and they won't always know what to do.
They don't know the how, or the whether,
the why.
They doubt,
but they do what they can and they try.

But others are wilfully weak,
and aware.
They know,
but they're too fucking careless to care.
They'll never reflect on their choices,
alone.
And one day,
they'll die in a bed on their own.

----------_Death
I could face the finish, gladly,
I could cross the final line -
And I wouldn't walk it sadly
If I had your hand in mine.

I could sail the silver ocean
Armed with nothing but an oar -
And I'd do it with devotion
If you watched me from the shore.

I could cut the ribbon cleanly,
I could ride the river's flow -
I could say so long serenely -

If you're with me when I go.


-------Hotline
I saw it before me in shadows of doubt -
My means to salvation, my only way out.
It sat there in silence, and captured me, caught -
Immune to my heartache, and deaf to my thought.

"I don't want a future," I solemnly swore -
"Of sadness and silence and loss anymore.
I don't want a witness to witness goodbye -
I just wanted someone to care when I cry."

I looked at it, waiting, and muttered a vow:
"Whatever. Let's do it. It's never or now.
I'm ending it here, of an evening, alone."

I reached out before me.

And picked up the phone.

-----Procastinate
I could be a sailor,
a soldier, a saint -
I could be a tailor,
though darling,
I ain't -
I could be a writer,
a waiter, and why -
I could be a fighter,
a lover, a spy.

I could be tomorrow -
I could be today -
I could be in sorrow,
or sweetness,
but hey -
That's not where I'm guided.
That isn't ahead.

Spent so long deciding,
I'm already dead.
